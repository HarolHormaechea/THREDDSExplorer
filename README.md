## Synopsis

THREDDS Explorer is a QGIS-based plug-in designed to make it easy for users to access georeferenced data accessible through any THREDDS based server.  

Data catalogues and maps are exposed to the user through a simple user interface, which allows him to choose any map or explore all contents of the server without resorting to exploring the default web based THREDDS interface.

This plug-in should work with most THREDDS servers, and will be able to retrieve any layer provided through WMS, WMS-T and/or WCS services published by the server.

## Installation
